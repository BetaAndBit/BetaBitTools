Your goal is to find Slawomir Pietraszko's credentials for the Proton server.
This is the only way for Bit to find the secret plans of Pietraszko's laboratory.
Enter the `proton()` command in order to start the adventure.
Remember that at any time you may add `hint=TRUE` argument to the executed command in order to get additional suggestions.

## TASK: proton.init

Pietraszko uses a password which is very difficult to guess.
At first, try to hack an account of a person which is not as cautious as Pietraszko.

But who is the weakest point? Initial investigation suggests that John Insecure doesn't care about security and has an account on the Proton server. He may use a password which is easy to crack.
Let's attack his account first!

Problem 1: Find the login of John Insecure.

Bit has scrapped 'employees' data (names and logins) from the www web page of Technical University of Warsaw. The data is in the data.frame `employees`.
Now, your task is to find John Insecure's login.
When you finally find out what John's login is, use `proton(action = "login", login="XYZ")` command, where XYZ is Insecure's login.

## TASK: proton.init.w

In `employees` dataset try to find a row which has `Insecure` value in the `surname` column.
Functions like `filter` or `arrange` from the `dplyr` package may be very useful.

## TASK: log.1

## TASK: log.2

## TASK: proton.login.init

Congratulations! You have found out what John Insecure's login is!
It is highly likely that he uses some typical password.
Bit downloaded from the Internet a database with 1000 most commonly used passwords.
You can find this database in the `top1000passwords` vector.

Problem 2: Find John Insecure's password.

Use `proton(action = "login", login="XYZ", password="ABC")` command in order to log into the Proton server with the given credentials.
If the password is correct, you will get the following message:
`Success! User is logged in!`.
Otherwise you will get:
`Password or login is incorrect!`.

## TASK: proton.login.init.w

Use the brute force method.
By using a loop, try to log in with subsequent passwords from `top1000passwords` vector as long as you receive:
`Success! User is logged in!`.

## TASK: proton.login.fail

Password or login is incorrect.

## TASK: proton.login.pass

Success! User is logged in!

## TASK: proton.login.pass.instr

Well done! This is the right password!
Bit used John Insecure's account in order to log into the Proton server.
It turns out that John has access to server logs.
Now, Bit wants to check from which workstation Pietraszko is frequently logging into the Proton server. Bit hopes that there will be some useful data.

Logs are in the `logs` dataset.
Consecutive columns contain information such as: who, when and from which computer logged into Proton.

Problem 3: Check from which server Pietraszko logs into the Proton server most often.

Use `proton(action = "server", host="XYZ")` command in order to learn more  about what can be found on the XYZ server.
The biggest chance to find something interesting is to find a server from which Pietraszko logs in the most often.

## TASK: "proton.login.pass.instr.w

In order to get to know from which server Pietraszko is logging the most often one may:
1. Use `filter` function to choose only Pietraszko's logs,
2. Use `group_by` and `summarise` to count the number of Pietraszko's logs into separate servers,
3. Use `arrange` function to sort servers' list by the frequency of logs.

Use `employees` database in order to check what Pietraszko's login is.

## TASK: proton.login.weak

Nice try, but there is nothing interesting about this login.
The weakest link of Proton server is John Insecure.
Try to find his login.

## TASK: proton.final

Congratulations!

You have cracked Pietraszko's password!
Secret plans of his lab are now in your hands.
What is in this mysterious lab?\nYou may read about it in the `Pietraszko's cave` story which is available at http://biecek.pl/BetaBit/Warsaw

Next adventure of Beta and Bit will be available soon.

## TASK: proton.host.instr

It turns out that Pietraszko often uses the public workstation 194.29.178.16.
What a carelessness.

Bit infiltrated this workstation easily. He downloaded `bash_history` file which contains a list of all commands that were entered into the server's console.
The chances are that some time ago Pietraszko typed a password into the console by mistake thinking that he was logging into the Proton server.

Problem 4: Find the Pietraszko's password.

In the `bash_history` dataset you will find all commands and parameters which have ever been entered.
Try to extract from this dataset only commands (only strings before space) and check whether one of them looks like a password.
Once you find the passord, use it to login into the proton server.

## TASK: proton.host.instr.w

Commands and parameters are separated by a space. In order to extract only names of commands from each line, you can use `gsub` or `strsplit` function.
After having all commands extracted you should check how often each command is used.
Perhaps it will turn out that one of typed in commands look like a password?

If you see something which looks like a password, you shall use `proton(action = "login", login="XYZ", password="ABC")` command to log into the Proton server with Pietraszko credentials.

## TASK: proton.host.instr.w

Bit spent some time to infiltrate this workstation.
But there is nothing interesting here.
Find the workstation which Pietraszko is using most often to log into the Proton server.
