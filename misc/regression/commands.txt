During their summer internship Beta and Bit are helping professor Pearson to analyse data from his educational research on Polish upper-secondary schools students.

Professor Pearson is mostly interested in educational inequalities, particularly in how the socio-economic status of the parents affects their children's educational attainment. He hopes his research will help to develop programmes providing support to young people from disadvantaged families and reducing inequalities in our society.

If you want to help Beta and Bit in their analysis, type:
  regression(subject = "Summer internship")

If you need help, try to add `hint = TRUE` and/or `techHint = TRUE` argument to the `regression()` function call.

## TASK: regression.task1

Dear Beta and Bit,

I sent you a dataset named 'dataFSW' for an analysis. An additional dataset called 'varLabels' contains variable labels so that you can check what each variable measures.

Let's start with something simple. Can you compute for me the correlations between the measures of cognitive abilities (`MATH_2009`, `READ_2009`, `SCIE_2009`) and the highest parental International Socio-Economic Index `hisei`?

You should get three correlations.

Please send me back a vector containing these three correlations by calling:
  `regression(subject = "Correlations", content = "vector of correlations")`

Best regards

Professor Pearson
